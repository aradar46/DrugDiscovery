## Computational Drug Discovery _ **Bioinformatics Project**

This notebook will be focusing on the **Computational Drug Discovery** aspect of the Bioinformatics Project. In this notebook, we will be performing the following tasks:

-**Part 1**: Data pre-processing

-**Part 2**: Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis

-**Part 3**: Descriptor Calculation and Dataset Preparation

-**Part 4**: Regression Models with Random Forest

-**Part 5**: Comparing Regressors

For bioactivity data pre-processing, we will be using the data retrieved from **ChEMBL** database.

This notebook is a developing modified version of the notebooks provided by **Chanin Nantasenamat** which you can find [Here](https://github.com/dataprofessor/bioinformatics_freecodecamp).
